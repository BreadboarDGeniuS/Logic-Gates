# BreadboarD GeniuS Logic Gates and Binary Counters
## Built around the ATTiny1616 and ATMega4809 MCU

## Description
This project implements various logic gates (AND/NAND, OR/NOR, XOR/XNOR, Dual NOT, MAJORITY/MINORITY) using the ATTiny1616 microcontroller. The code is designed for educational purposes and to demonstrate the implementation of basic digital logic in embedded systems.
The logic gates will be available to buy on:

TINDIE https://www.tindie.com/stores/breadboardgenius/
ETSY https://breadboardgenius.etsy.com
EBAY https://www.ebay.co.uk/usr/electrode101

To purchase the gate kits and better support the project, it's best to buy on TINDIE, as they charge the least fees. The order they are listed above is from the lowest fees to the highest fees

## Features
- Implements AND/NAND, OR/NOR, XOR/XNOR, NOT, and MAJORITY/MINORITY gates.
- Configurable input pins.
- Easily expandable for additional logic gates.
- Written in C++ for use with ATTiny1616 & ATMega4809 MCU.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BreadBoardGeniuS/logic-gates.git`
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Atmel Studio, VSCode).
3. Compile and upload the code to your ATTiny1616 MCU.
